**Spotify Developer App Configuration Confirmed:**

App Name: spotifyaitrack
Client ID: dcc2df507bde447c93a0199358ca219d
Client Secret: 128089720b414d1e8233290d94fb38a0
Website: https://primospheres.studio

**Key Redirect URIs (relevant ones):**
- ✅ `https://primosphere.studio/auth/callback` (CORRECT - already configured)
- ✅ `https://primosphere.studio/callback` (alternative)
- ❌ `http://localhost:3000` (development only)
- ❌ `http://localhost:8080/callback` (development only)

**Analysis:**
The Spotify app already has the correct production redirect URI (`https://primosphere.studio/auth/callback`) configured. The issue is likely that the application code is still using localhost redirect URIs instead of reading from the environment variable or using the production URL.

**Focus Areas for the Fix:**
1. Ensure the application uses `https://primosphere.studio/auth/callback` in production
2. Verify environment variable `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://primosphere.studio/auth/callback` is being read correctly
3. Check that no hardcoded localhost URLs are overriding the environment configuration
4. The Spotify app configuration is already correct, so this is purely an application code issue

@dzp5103 The Spotify developer app is properly configured with the production redirect URI, so the fix should focus on ensuring your application code uses the correct environment-based redirect URI.
